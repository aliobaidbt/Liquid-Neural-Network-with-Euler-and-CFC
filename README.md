# Liquid-Neural-Network-with-Euler-and-CFC
A comparative study of Liquid Neural Network (LNN) architectures for high-performance pixel-wise classification. This repository features an Euler-based ODE solver LNN and an analytically optimized Closed-form Continuous (CfC) LNN, both designed for real-time segmentation and optimized for CUDA 11.7 hardware acceleration
